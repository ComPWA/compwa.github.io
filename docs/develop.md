# Help developing

[![Open in Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/vscode-open-blue?logo=visualstudiocode)](https://open.vscode.dev/ComPWA/compwa.github.io)

This page describes some of the tools and conventions followed by
[Common Partial Wave Analysis](https://github.com/ComPWA). Where possible, we use the
[source code of the AmpForm repository](https://github.com/ComPWA/AmpForm) as example,
because its file structure is comparable to that of other ComPWA repositories.

:::::{tip}
To start developing, simply run the following from a cloned repository on your machine:
::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Conda

```shell
conda env create
conda activate ampform
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

:::
:::{tab-item} uv

```shell
uv venv -p 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -c .constraints/py3.10.txt -e '.[dev]'
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

:::
:::{tab-item} Python venv

```shell
python3 -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -c .constraints/py3.10.txt -e '.[dev]'
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

Replace `3.10` with the Python version you use on your machine.

## Local set-up

### Virtual environment

When developing source code, it is safest to work within a
[virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer), so
that all package dependencies and developer tools are safely contained. This is helpful
in case something goes wrong with the dependencies: just trash the environment and
recreate it. In addition, you can easily install other versions of the dependencies,
without affecting other packages you may be working on.

Somme common tools to manage virtual environments are [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com), [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and [Python's built-in `venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). In any of these cases, you have to activate the environment whenever you want to run the framework or use the developer tools.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Conda environment

[Conda](https://www.anaconda.com) can be installed without administrator rights. It is
recommended to [download
Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers), as it is
much smaller than Anaconda. In addition, Conda can install more than just Python
packages.

The virtual environment of repositories that provide a [Conda environment file](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) (`environment.yml`), can simply be created with

```shell
conda env create
```

Conda now creates an environment with a name that is defined in the `environment.yml` file. In addition, it will install the framework itself in ["editable" mode](#editable-installation), so that you can start developing right away.

:::
:::{tab-item} Python venv

If you have [Python's `venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), available on
your system, you can create a virtual environment with it. Navigate to some convenient
folder and run:

```shell
python3 -m venv ./venv
```

This creates a folder called {file}`venv` where all Python packages will be contained.
To activate the environment, run:

```shell
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Now you can safely install the package you want to work on (see
["editable" mode](#editable-installation)), as well as any additional required packages
(see [optional dependencies](#optional-dependencies)):

```shell
pip install -e .
```

:::
:::{tab-item} uv

An upcoming and super fast Python package installer is [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started). It can be installed without administrator rights and comes with its own `venv` command to manage virtual environments. Here's how to do it for a specific Python version:[^deadsnakes]

```shell
uv venv -p 3.10
```

This creates a folder called {file}`.venv` where all Python packages will be contained. To activate the environment, run:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You can safely install the package you want to work on (see ["editable" mode](#editable-installation)), as well as any additional required packages (see [optional dependencies](#optional-dependencies)):

```shell
uv pip install -e .
```

[^deadsnakes]: To install a specific Python version on Ubuntu, use [deadsnakes](https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa).

:::
::::

:::{tip}
[Install `direnv`](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) if a repository contains a {file}`.envrc` file. This ensures that the appropriate environment is activates once you navigate into the repository!
:::

### Editable installation

When developing a package, it is most convenient if you install it in
["editable" mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#editable-installs).
This allows you to tweak the source code and try out new ideas immediately, because the
source code is considered the 'installation'.

With [`pip install`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install), a package can be
installed in "editable" mode with the
[`-e` flag](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#install-editable). Simply
[clone](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository#_git_cloning)
the repository you want to work on, navigate into it, and run:

```shell
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

:::{toggle}
Internally, this calls:

```shell
python3 setup.py develop
```

:::

This will also install all dependencies required by the package.

### Optional dependencies

Some packages suggest
[optional dependencies](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/dependency_management.html#optional-dependencies).
They can be installed with
[`pip`'s "extras" syntax](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-setuptools-extras).
Some examples would be:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Bash

```shell
pip install tensorwaves[jax,scipy]
pip install .[test]  # local directory, not editable
pip install -e .[dev]  #  editable + all dev requirements
```

:::
:::{tab-item} Z shell

```shell
pip install "tensorwaves[jax,scipy]"
pip install ".[test]"  # local directory, not editable
pip install -e ".[dev]"  #  editable + all dev requirements
```

:::
::::

Developers require several additional tools besides the dependencies required to run the
package itself (see {ref}`develop:Automated coding conventions`). All those additional
requirements can be installed with the last example.

### Pinning dependency versions

To ensure that developers use exactly the same versions of the package dependencies and
developer requirements, some of the repositories provide
[constraint files](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#constraints-files). These
files can be used to 'pin' all versions of installed packages as follows:

:::{margin}
Requirements may differ per Python version, so there is one constraint file for each
version of Python that the package supports.
:::

```shell
python3 -m pip install -c .constraints/py3.10.txt -e .
```

The syntax works just as well for {ref}`develop:Optional dependencies`:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Bash

```shell
python3 -m pip install -c .constraints/py3.10.txt -e .[doc,sty]
python3 -m pip install -c .constraints/py3.10.txt -e .[test]
python3 -m pip install -c .constraints/py3.10.txt -e .[dev]
```

:::
:::{tab-item} Z shell

```shell
python3 -m pip install -c .constraints/py3.10.txt -e ".[doc,sty]"
python3 -m pip install -c .constraints/py3.10.txt -e ".[test]"
python3 -m pip install -c .constraints/py3.10.txt -e ".[dev]"
```

:::
::::

The constraint files are updated automatically with
[`pip-tools`](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) through
{ref}`develop:GitHub Actions`. See
[`requirements-pr.yml`](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/actions/workflows/requirements-pr.yml)
and
[`requirements-cron.yml`](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/actions/workflows/requirements-cron.yml).

:::{note}
Constraint files ensure that the framework is _deterministic and reproducible_ (up to
testing) _for all commits and versions_, which is vital for both users (doing analysis)
and for developers (for instance with
{ref}`continuous integration <develop:GitHub Actions>`). In other words, it provides a
way out of ["dependency hell"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).
:::

### Updating

It may be that new commits in the repository modify the dependencies. In that case, you
have to rerun this command after pulling new commits from the repository:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Bash

```shell
git checkout main
git pull
pip install -c .constraints/py3.10.txt -e .[dev]
```

:::
:::{tab-item} Z shell

```shell
git checkout main
git pull
pip install -c .constraints/py3.10.txt -e ".[dev]"
```

:::
::::

If you still have problems, it may be that certain dependencies have become redundant.
In that case, trash the virtual environment and
{ref}`create a new one <develop:Virtual environment>`.

### Julia

[Julia](https://julialang.org) is an upcoming programming language in High-Energy
Physics. While ComPWA is mainly developed in Python, we try to taylor to new trends and
are experimenting with Julia as well.

Julia can be downloaded [here](https://julialang.org/downloads) or can be installed
within your virtual environment with [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). To
install Julia system-wide in Linux and Mac, you'll have to unpack the downloaded
[tar](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)>) file to a location that is easily
accessible. Here's an example, where we also make the Julia executable available to the
system:

:::::{tab-set}
::::{tab-item} Conda

Install [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) for installing and managing
Julia versions.

```shell
conda install juliaup -c conda-forge
```

:::{dropdown} Optional: select Julia version
By default, this provides you with the latest Julia release. **Optionally**, you can
switch versions as follows:

```shell
conda install juliaup -c conda-forge
juliaup add 1.9
juliaup default 1.9
```

You can switch back to the latest version with:

```shell
juliaup default release
```

:::
::::
::::{tab-item} Home-folder

```shell
cd ~/Downloads
tar xzf julia-1.10.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
mkdir ~/opt ~/bin
mv julia-1.10.3 ~/opt/
ln -s ~/opt/julia-1.10.3/bin/julia ~/bin/julia
```

Make sure that `~/bin` is listed in the `PATH` environment variable, e.g. by updating it
through your `.bashrc` file:

```shell
export PATH="~/bin:$PATH"
```

::::
::::{tab-item} System-wide

```shell
cd ~/Downloads
tar xzf julia-1.10.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
sudo mv julia-1.10.3 /opt/
sudo ln -s /opt/julia-1.10.3/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia
```

::::
:::::

Just as in Python, it's safest to work with a
{ref}`virtual environment <develop:Virtual environment>`. You can read more about Julia
environments [here](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments). An environment is
defined through a
[`Project.toml` file](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/toml-files/#Project.toml) (which
defines direct dependencies) and a
[`Manifest.toml` file](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/toml-files/#Manifest.toml)
(which exactly pins the installed versions of _all_ recursive dependencies). Don't touch
these files―they are automatically managed by the
[package manager](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/managing-packages). It does make
sense though to commit both `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files, so that the
environment is reproducible for each commit (see also
{ref}`develop:Pinning dependency versions`).

:::{seealso}
Have a look {ref}`here<develop:IJulia notebooks>` if you want to integrate Jupyter
notebooks with Julia kernels into your {ref}`documentation<develop:Documentation>`.
:::

## Automated coding conventions

Where possible, we define and enforce our coding conventions through automated tools, instead of describing them in documentation. These tools perform their checks when you commit files locally (see {ref}`develop:Pre-commit`), when {ref}`running checks locally <develop:checks>`, and when you make a {ref}`pull request <develop:Collaboration>`.

The tools are mainly configured through [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/blob/main/pyproject.toml) and the workflow files under [`.github`](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/blob/main/.github). These configuration files are kept up to date through the [ComPWA/policy](https://compwa.github.io/policy) repository, which essentially defines the developer environment across [all ComPWA repositories](https://github.com/orgs/ComPWA/repositories?q=archived%3Ano&type=all&language=&sort=name).

If you run into persistent linting errors, this may mean we need to further specify our conventions. In that case, it's best to {ref}`create an issue <develop:Issue management>` or a {ref}`pull request <develop:Collaboration>` at [ComPWA/policy](https://github.com/ComPWA/policy) and propose a policy change that can be formulated through those config files.

### Pre-commit

All {ref}`style checks <develop:Style checks>` are enforced through a tool called
[{command}`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com). It's best to activate this tool locally
as well. This has to be done only once, after you clone the repository:

```shell
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

:::{margin} Initializing pre-commit
The first time you run {command}`pre-commit` after installing or updating its checks, it
may take some time to initialize.
:::

Upon committing, {command}`pre-commit` runs a set of checks as defined in the file
[{file}`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml)
over all staged files. You can also quickly run all checks over _all_ indexed files in
the repository with the command:

```shell
pre-commit run -a
```

Whenever you {ref}`submit a pull request <develop:Collaboration>`, this command is
automatically run
[on GitHub actions](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
and [on pre-commit.ci](https://results.pre-commit.ci/install/github/18435973) , ensuring
that all files in the repository follow the same conventions as set in the config files
of these tools.

### Checks

<!-- cspell:ignore poethepoet -->

Many ComPWA repositories define a set of tasks that serve as way to run CI checks locally. These checks are run through the [Poe the Poet](https://poethepoet.natn.io) task runner and are defined under the [`[tool.poe.tasks]`](https://poethepoet.natn.io/tasks/index.html) table in [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/blob/main/pyproject.toml). The available checks can be listed with

```shell
poe
```

Poe the Poet is installed through the `dev` dependency group. However, since the `poe` command can automatically generate a `uv` virtual environment, it can be useful to install it system-wide, so that you can run the checks without having to activate the environment.

```shell
uv tool install poethepoet
```

### GitHub Actions

All {ref}`style checks <develop:Style checks>`, testing of the
{ref}`documentation and links <develop:Documentation>`, and
{ref}`unit tests <develop:Testing>` are performed upon each pull request through
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) (see status overview
[here](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/actions)). The checks are defined under the
[`.github`](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/blob/main/.github) folder. All checks
performed for each PR have to pass before the PR can be merged.

## Style checks

### Formatting

Formatters are tools that automatically format source code, or some document. Naturally,
this speeds up your own programming, but these tools are particularly important when
{ref}`collaborating <develop:Collaboration>`, because a standardized format avoids line
conflicts in Git and makes diffs in code review easier to read.

For the Python source code, we use [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io) and
[`isort`](https://isort.readthedocs.io) ([through
Ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#isort-i)). For other code, we use
[Prettier](https://prettier.io). All of these formatters are "opinionated formatters":
they offer only limited configuration options, as to make formatting as conform as
possible.

{ref}`develop:Pre-commit` performs some additional formatting jobs. For instance, it
formats Jupyter notebooks with [nbQA](https://github.com/nbQA-dev/nbQA) and strips them
of any output cells with [`nbstripout`](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout).

<!-- cspell:ignore nbstripout -->

### Linting

Linters point out when certain style conventions are not correctly followed. Unlike with
{ref}`formatters <develop:Formatting>`, you have to fix the errors yourself. As
mentioned in {ref}`develop:Automated coding conventions`, style conventions are
formulated in config files. The main linter that ComPWA projects use, is
[Ruff](https://ruff.rs).

### Spelling

Throughout this repository, we follow American English
([en-us](https://www.andiamo.co.uk/resources/iso-language-codes)) spelling conventions.
As a tool, we use
[cSpell](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell/blob/master/packages/cspell/README.md),
because it allows to check variable names in camel case and snake case. This way, a
spelling checker helps you avoid mistakes in the code as well! cSpell is enforced
through pre-commit.

Accepted words are tracked through the
[`.cspell.json`](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/blob/main/.cspell.json) file. As with
the other config files,
[`.cspell.json`](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/blob/main/.cspell.json) formulates
our conventions with regard to spelling and can be continuously updated while our code
base develops. In the file, the `words` section lists words that you want to see as
suggested corrections, while `ignoreWords` are just the words that won't be flagged. Try
to be sparse in adding words: if some word is just specific to one file, you can
[ignore it inline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cspell#ignore), or you can add the file
to the `ignorePaths` section if you want to ignore it completely.

It is easiest to use cSpell in {ref}`develop:Visual Studio Code`, through the
[Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
extension: it provides linting, suggests corrections from the {code}`words` section, and
enables you to quickly add or ignore words through the
[`.cspell.json`](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/blob/main/.cspell.json) file.

## Testing

The fastest way to run all tests is with the command:

```shell
pytest -n auto
```

The flag {command}`-n auto` causes {code}`pytest` to
[run with a distributed strategy](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-xdist).

::::{margin}
:::{tip}
In VS&nbsp;Code, you can visualize test coverage are covered with through its built-in [test coverage support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing#_run-tests-with-coverage).
:::
::::

<!-- cspell:ignore htmlcov -->

Try to keep test coverage high. You can compute current coverage by running

```shell
poe cov
```

and opening {file}`htmlcov/index.html` in a browser.

To get an idea of performance per component, run

```shell
pytest --profile-svg
```

and check the stats and the {file}`prof/combined.svg` output file.

:::{note}
Jupyter notebooks can also be used as tests. See more info
{ref}`here <develop:Jupyter Notebooks>`.
:::

## Documentation

The documentation that you find on ComPWA pages like [pwa.rtfd.io](https://pwa.rtfd.io)
is built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org). Sphinx also
[builds the API page](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-apidoc.html) of
the packages and therefore checks whether the
[docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257) in the Python source code are
valid and correctly interlinked.

We make use of [Markedly Structured Text](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io) (MyST), so
you can write the documentation in both [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) and
[reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html).
In addition, it's easy to write (interactive) code examples in Jupyter notebooks and
host them on the website (see [MyST-NB](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io))!

### Documentation preview

You can quickly build the documentation with the command:

```shell
poe doc
```

<!-- cspell:ignore autobuild -->

If you are doing a lot of work on the documentation,
[`sphinx-autobuild`](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autobuild) is a nice tool to use.
Just run:

<!-- cspell:ignore doclive -->

```shell
poe doclive
```

This will start a server [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) where you can
continuously preview the changes you make to the documentation.

Finally, a nice feature of [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org), where we host our
documentation, is that documentation is built for each pull request as well. This means
that you can view the documentation for your changes as well. For more info, see
[here](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/autobuild-docs-for-pull-requests.html),
or just click "details" under the RTD check once you submit your PR.

### Jupyter Notebooks

::::{margin}
:::{tip}
Sometimes it happens that your Jupyter installation does not recognize your
{ref}`virtual environment <develop:Virtual environment>`. In that case, have a look at
[these instructions](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html#kernels-for-different-environments).
:::
::::

The [docs](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/tree/main/docs) folder can also contain
Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks are rendered as HTML by
[MyST-NB](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io). The notebooks are also run and tested
whenever you make a {ref}`pull request <develop:Collaboration>`, so they also serve as
**integration tests**.

If you want to improve those notebooks, we recommend working with
[Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable), which is
{ref}`installed with the dev requirements <develop:Optional dependencies>`. Jupyter Lab
offers a nicer developer experience than the default Jupyter notebook editor does. A few
useful Jupyter Lab plugins are also installed through the
{ref}`optional dependencies <develop:Optional dependencies>`.

Now, if you want to test all notebooks in the documentation folder and check what their
output cells will look like in the {ref}`develop:Documentation`, you can do this with:

<!-- cspell:ignore docnb docnblive -->

```shell
poe docnb
```

This command takes more time than `poe doc`, but it is good practice to do this before you submit a pull request. It's also possible to continuously generate the HTML pages _including cell output_ while you work on the notebooks with:

```shell
poe docnblive
```

:::{tip}
Notebooks are automatically formatted through {ref}`pre-commit <develop:Pre-commit>` (see {ref}`develop:Formatting`). If you want to format the notebooks automatically as you're working, you can do so with [`jupyterlab-code-formatter`](https://jupyterlab-code-formatter.readthedocs.io), which is automatically {ref}`installed with the dev requirements <develop:Optional dependencies>`.

For this, you need to set Ruff as the formatter (see [](#formatting)) for `jupyterlab-code-formatter`:

1. Open Jupyter Lab Settings ({kbd}`Ctrl+,` / {kbd}`⌘+,`).
2. Select the "Jupyterlab Code Formatter" plugin from the left sidebar.
3. Under `default_formatter`, list two Python formatters: `ruffformat` and `ruff`. The first is the actual [Ruff formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter) that mimics `black`, the second is for Ruff auto-fixes of linting rules. (The default formatters are `isort` and `black`—you should overwrite these.) <!-- cspell:ignore ruffformat -->
4. **Optional:** Activate format-on-save by ticking "Auto format config".

Alternatively, you can open the settings for the "Jupyterlab Code Formatter" as JSON and set it to:

```json
{
  "preferences": {
    "default_formatter": {
      "python": ["ruffformat", "ruff"]
    }
  },
  "formatOnSave": true
}
```

:::

#### IJulia notebooks

It's also possible to execute and render Jupyter notebooks with Julia kernels. For this,
{ref}`install Julia<develop:Julia>` and install
[IJulia](https://julialang.github.io/IJulia.jl):

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Shell

```shell
julia -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.add("IJulia")'
```

:::
:::{tab-item} Julia

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("IJulia")
```

:::
::::

Usually, this also installs a Jupyter kernel directly. **Optionally**, you can define a
Jupyter kernel manually:

<!-- cspell:ignore installkernel -->

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Shell

```shell
julia -e 'using IJulia; installkernel("julia")'
```

:::
:::{tab-item} Julia

```julia
using IJulia
installkernel("julia")
```

:::
::::

and select it as kernel in the Jupyter notebook.

:::{note}
As mentioned in {ref}`develop:Julia`, Julia can be installed within your Conda
environment through [`juliaup`](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/juliaup). This is,
however, not yet a virtual environment for Julia itself. You can create a virtual
environment for Julia itself by for instance defining it through a code cell like this:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")  # if environment is defined in this folder
Pkg.instantiate()
```

See **[TR-019](https://compwa.github.io/report/019)** for an example.
:::

Additionally, you can install a [Language Server](https://jupyterlab-lsp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Language%20Servers.html) for Julia in Jupyter Lab. To do so, run:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Shell

```shell
julia -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.add("LanguageServer")'
```

:::
:::{tab-item} Julia

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("LanguageServer")
```

:::
::::

## Collaboration

The source code of all ComPWA repositories is maintained with [Git](https://git-scm.com)
and [GitHub](https://github.com). We keep track of issues with the code, documentation,
and developer set-up with GitHub issues (see for instance
[here](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/issues)). This is also the place where you can
[report bugs](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/issues/new/choose).

:::{tip}
If you are new to working with GitHub, have a look at the tutorials on
[GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com). For good tutorials on Git, see:

- [freeCodeCamp's "Gitting Things Done"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/gitting-things-done-book)
  <!-- cspell:ignore gitting -->
- [HSF Software Training Center](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice)
- The [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book

:::

### Issue management

We keep track of issue dependencies, time estimates, planning, pipeline statuses, et
cetera with GitHub project boards ([GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues)).
The main project boards are:

- [Public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/ComPWA/projects/4)
- [Development planning](https://github.com/orgs/ComPWA/projects/5)

Some issues are not public. To get access, you can request to become member of the
[ComPWA](https://github.com/ComPWA) GitHub organization. Other information that is
publicly available are:

- [Issue labels](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/labels): help to categorize issues by
  type (maintenance, enhancement, bug, etc.). The labels are also used to in the
  sub-sections of the release notes.
- [Milestones](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/milestones?direction=asc&sort=title&state=open):
  way to bundle issues and PRs for upcoming releases.
- [Releases](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/releases).

All of these are important for the {ref}`develop:Release flow` and therefore also serve
as a way to document the framework.

### Branching model

While our aim is to maintain long-term, stable projects,
{ref}`PWA software projects <pwa:software:software inventory>` are academic projects
that are subject to change and often require swift modifications or new features for
ongoing analyses. For this reason, we work in different layers of development. These
layers are represented by Git branches.

![Epic branches](./_static/epic-branches.svg)

(stable-branch)=

#### `stable` branch

Represents the _latest release_ of the package that can be found on both the GitHub
release page and on PyPI (see {ref}`develop:Release flow`). The documentation of the
`stable` branch is also the default view
{ref}`you see on Read the Docs <develop:Documentation>` (RTD). See e.g.
[ampform.rtfd.io/en/stable](https://ampform.rtfd.io/en/stable).

(main-branch)=

#### `main` branch

Represents the upcoming release of the package. This branch is not guaranteed to be
stable, but has high {ref}`CI standards <develop:GitHub Actions>` and can only be
updated through reviewed pull requests. The documentation of the `main` branch can be
found on RTD under "latest", see e.g.
[ampform.rtfd.io/en/latest](https://ampform.rtfd.io/en/latest).

#### Epic branches

:::{margin}
The word ["epic"](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics) is used in
[agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).
:::

When working on a feature or larger refactoring that may take a longer time (think of
implementing a new PWA formalism), we isolate its development under an 'epic branch',
separate from the `main` branch. Eventually, this epic branch is to be merged back into
the `main`, until then it is available for discussion and testing.

Pull requests to an epic branch require no code review and the CI checks are less
strict. This allows for faster development, while still offering the possibility to
discuss new implementations and
{ref}`keeping track of related issues <develop:Issue management>`.

Epic branches can be installed through PyPI as well. Say that a certain epic is located
under the branch `epic/some-title` and that the source code is located under
[https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform](https://github.com/compwa/ampform), it can be
installed as follows:

```shell
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform@epic/some-title
```

#### Feature branches

The {ref}`main-branch` and {ref}`develop:epic branches` can be updated through pull
requests. It is best to create such a pull request from a separate branch, which does
not have any CI or code review restrictions. We call this a "feature branch".

### Commit conventions

- Please use [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org): start
  the commit with one of the semantic keywords below in UPPER CASE, followed by
  [a column](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers), then the commit header.
  The message itself should be in imperative mood — just imagine the commit to give a
  command to the code framework. So for instance:

  ```none
  DX: implement coverage report tools
  FIX: remove typo in raised `ValueError` message
  MAINT: remove redundant print statements
  DOC: rewrite welcome pages
  BREAK: remove `formulate_model()` alias method
  ```

  The allowed semantic keywords (commit types) are as follows:[^1]

  | [Commit type](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) | [Repository label](https://github.com/organizations/ComPWA/settings/repository-defaults)                                                                                                             | Description                                         |

- Keep pull requests small. If the issue you try to address is too big, discuss in the
  team whether the issue can be converted into an
  [Epic](https://blog.zenhub.com/working-with-epics-in-github) and split up into smaller
  tasks.

- Before creating a pull request, run {ref}`develop:checks`.

- Also use a [conventional commit message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) style
  for the PR title. This is because we follow a
  [linear commit history](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/requiring-a-linear-commit-history)
  and the PR title will become the eventual commit message. A linear commit history is
  important for the {ref}`develop:Release flow` and it is easier to navigate through
  changes once something goes wrong. In fact, in a linear commit history, commits that a
  have been merged into the {ref}`main-branch` become more like small intermediate
  patches between the minor and major releases.

  Note that a conventional commit message style is
  {ref}`enforced through GitHub Actions <develop:GitHub Actions>` with
  [`commitlint`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint), as well as a
  check on {ref}`PR labels <develop:Issue management>` (see example
  [here](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/actions?query=workflow%3A%22PR+linting%22)).
  The commit messages are centrally defined for the ComPWA organization at
  [ComPWA/commitlint-config](https://github.com/ComPWA/commitlint-config).

- PRs can only be merged through 'squash and merge'. There, you will see a summary based
  on the separate commits that constitute this PR. Leave the relevant commits in as
  bullet points. See the
  [commit history](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/commits/main) for examples. This
  comes in especially handy when {ref}`drafting a release <develop:Release flow>`!

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
[^1]: The commit types for the ComPWA organization are defined
    [here](https://github.com/ComPWA/commitlint-config/blob/main/index.js). See also
    [ComPWA/.github#7](https://github.com/ComPWA/.github/issues/7) for a discussion on
    these commit types.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Release flow

Releases are managed with the
[GitHub release page](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository),
see for instance [the one for AmpForm](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/releases). The
release notes there are
[automatically generated from the PRs](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter)
that were merged into the main branch since the previous tag and can be viewed and
edited as a release draft if you are a member of the ComPWA organization. Each of the
entries are generated from the PR titles, categorized by issue label (see configuration
in
[`.github/release-drafter.yml`](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/blob/main/.github/release-drafter.yml)).

Once a release is made on GitHub for a repository with source code for a Python package,
a new version is automatically published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org) and the
[`stable` branch](#stable-branch) is updated to this latest tag. The package version is
taken from the Git tag associated with the release on GitHub (see
[setuptools-scm](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm)). This way, the release notes
on GitHub serve as a changelog as well!

Release tags **have to follow the [Semantic Versioning scheme](https://semver.org)**!
This ensures that the tag can be used by
[setuptools-scm](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm) (in case the repository is a
Python package). In addition, {ref}`milestones <develop:Issue management>` with the same
name as the release tag are automatically closed.

## Code editors

Even though we try to standardize the developer set-up of the repositories, we encourage
you to use the code editors that you feel comfortable with. Where possible, we therefore
define settings of linters, formatters, etc in config files that are specific to those
tools (using `pyproject.toml` where possible), not in the configuration files of the
editors.

Still, where code editor settings can be shared through configuration files in the
repository, we provide recommended settings for the code editor as well. This is
especially the case for [VSCode](#visual-studio-code).

:::{tip}

<!-- cspell:ignore Intelli vimrc -->

We are open to other code editors as well. An example would be maintaining a
[local vimrc](https://github.com/embear/vim-localvimrc) for users who prefer
[VIM](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)>). Other IDEs we'd like to support are
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm), [Atom](https://atom.io),
[IntelliJ with Python](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/plugin-overview.html#b370507b).
So we'll gladly integrate your editor settings where possible as you
[contribute](#collaboration) to the frameworks!
:::

### Visual Studio code

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as it's free,
regularly updated, and very flexible through it's wide offer of user extensions.

If you add or open this repository as a
[VSCode workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces), the
file
[`.vscode/settings.json`](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/blob/main/.vscode/settings.json)
will ensure that you have the right developer settings for this repository. In addition,
VSCode will automatically recommend you to install a number of extensions that we use
when working on this code base.
[They are defined](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_6#_workspace-extension-recommendations)
in the
[`.vscode/extensions.json`](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform/blob/main/.vscode/extensions.json)
file.

You can still specify your own settings in
[either the user or encompassing workspace settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings),
as the VSCode settings that come with this are folder settings.

:::{dropdown} Conda and VSCode
ComPWA projects are best developed {ref}`with Conda <develop:Virtual environment>` and
VSCode. The complete developer install procedure then becomes:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform  # or some other repo
cd ampform
conda env create
conda activate pwa  # or whatever the environment name is
code .  # open folder in VSCode
```

## Writing durable software

ComPWA strives to follow best practices from software development in industry. Following
these standards not only makes the code easier to maintain and the software more
reliable, it also provides you with the opportunity to learn about these practices while
developing the code-base. Below you can find some resources we highly recommend you to
be familiar with.
